# pwd-racetrack
A Pinewood Derby racetrack timer and start gate electronics circuits + firmware.

This software implements the firmware for a Pinewood Derby race track
electronics. The race track receives commands, like the setup or start commands
and sends back results, like the finishing times for each lane after a heat ends.

The racetrack electronics in the subdirectory circuits consists of three main parts:
- the main controller based on an Arduino Due with a protoype extension board.
  The extension board implements the connections to the finish line display
  modules and to the start gate.
- the display modules (one per lane) implement the main display of the achieved
  place in the heat and the display of the time in milliseconds. Also the LDR
  (Light Dependent Resistor) needed to detect the interruption of the laser
  beam is implemented on this module.
- the start gate electronics. This part is a separate Arduino Pro Mini
  controlling four RFID readers to detect the cars on each track and the
  solenoid for opening the start gate.
