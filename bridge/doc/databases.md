## DB structure definition ##

### Race Database ###

The database shall hold the basic information about a race. The whole race is
contained in one key, which is typically the year, followed by a string identifying
the race or demonstration etc. 

Properties of the race are:

| Property       | Type   | Description                                |
|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------|
| lanes          | number | number of lanes of the race track          |
| heatsQuali     | number | number of heats in the qualification round |
| heatsFinals    | number | number of heats in the final round         |
| finalCarCount  | number | how many cars are in the final round       |
| cars           | array  | array of car objecfs in this race          |

Properties of the car arrays are:

| Property        | Type   | Description                                         |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| \<startnumber\> | string | uuid or other key from the Car Database             |

```

### Car Database ###

The database shall hold the basic information about each car. The key should be 
a UUID identifier or a RFID, whichever is more suitable.

Properties of the car are:

| Property       | Type   | Description                                                                   |

### Race Config Database ###

The database shall hold the lane assignments for races with a predfined number of participants.
The number of cars equals the number of heats. Currently we store only configs for 4 lanes.
The key is the number of lanes followed by a minus sign and the number of cars/heats.

The value of a raceconfig is just an array of \<noOfHeats\> heat config objects, consisting 
of an arrays of 4 car numbers:

Properties of each heat config object are:

| Property       | Type   | Description                                    |
|----------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| \<heatnumber\> | Array  | contains a lane array                          |

Lane array members:

| Property       | Type   | Description                                    |
|----------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| \<carnumber\>  | number | startnumber of a car that starts in the lane   |
